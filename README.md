# Prerequisites
- Visual Studio: Either Community (Windows) or Code (Windows, MacOS).
- CefSharp: Chromium based browser control for .NET apps
- .NET Framework basic knowledge with C#

# Running locally
- For using this sample, you need an Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). 
- Connect your Forge App to a Specific BIM 360 Account, follow the [tutorial](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/get-access-to-account/)
- Download the repository, open `BimProjectSetupTool.sln` Solution on Visual Studio. The build process should download the required packages (**Autodesk.Forge** and dependencies). Compile and build the project, run it, please check the [User Guide](BIM360-ProjectSetupTool-UsageGuide.pdf) for all the details about usage and preparation of csv files.

# Hot to use Custom.bat
- See the steps from 'Running locally' to build the project
- Go to **.bin/Debug/sample** folder
- Edit the **Custom.bat** file and add your details
- There are two files **BIM360_Custom_Template**, one is a CSV-File and the other one an Excel-File
- You can edit the Excel-File for your purpose and save it as CSV-File. You can also directy change the CSV-File. Remeber: **the program uses only the CSV-File, so be sure to have the information saved in this file before starting the program**.
- After changing the BIM360_Custom_Template run the **Custom.bat** file
- For information on what the program has done you can go to **.bin/Debug/Log** folder read the log files. **logImportant.txt** should be always checked as it provides information of default values or skipped parameters.
- You will see an error if the CSV-File was not correctly populated. Specific information about the error will be printed on the console and will be saved in the log files.
- For every run of the program the log files will be deleted so you can't see old log files, just the last ones.

# Important notes on Custom.bat
- If you just want to add users to a project delete all the information in the columns from "root_folder" to "role_permission", but don't delete the columns.
- After running the programm it is still possible to add new information in the CSV-File and run the program again. Everything is checked and only the new information will be updated in BIM360.
- Soon there will be a tutorial video with more information

# Further Reading
**Documentation:**
- [BIM 360 API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview/) and [App Provisioning](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps)


# Tips & Tricks
- At least one path to an input file must be provided with the -p, -x or -u options;
- Special care must be taken when editing the file in Microsoft Excel:
    1. Make sure that Excel does not alter the date formatting to the System format on the machine which the file is edited. By default the dd/MM/YYYY is used in the CSV to format the date. When the Windows system uses a different time/date format, this sometimes causes Excel to save the date to the default Windows system format. This format can be changed in Configuration Panel | Regional Settings
    2. Make sure the .CSV file is formatted in UTF-8 code.
    3. Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad++ after it was saved to ensure the above two points.
- Logging can be configured in the Nlog.config file. Further information can be found here: https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file.
- If running the tool from the batch file under sample folder, please make sure to set FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, FORGE_BIM_ACCOUNT_ID correctly(**DO NOT** include quotation marks).
- Currently, the following project services could be activated:

    | Service Type | Description | 
    | :-----:| :----: | 
    | admin | BIM 360 Project Administration Service | 
    | doc_manager | BIM 360 Document Management Service | 
    | pm | BIM 360 Project Management Service | 
    | fng | BIM 360 Field Management Service |
    | collab | BIM 360 Design Collaboration Service | 
    | cost | BIM 360 Cost Management Service | 
    | gng | BIM 360 Model Coordination Service | 
    | plan | BIM 360 Plan Classic Service | 
    | field | BIM 360 Field Classic Service | 
    | glue | BIM 360 Glue Classic Service | 
- Project admin has to accept the invitation from email to make the services accessable.

# Limitation
