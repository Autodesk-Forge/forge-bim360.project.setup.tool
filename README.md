# Further Reading
**Documentation:**
- [BIM 360 API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview/) and [App Provisioning](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps)


# Tips & Tricks
- At least one path to an input file must be provided with the -p, -x or -u options;
- Special care must be taken when editing the file in Microsoft Excel:
    1. Make sure that Excel does not alter the date formatting to the System format on the machine which the file is edited. By default the dd/MM/YYYY is used in the CSV to format the date. When the Windows system uses a different time/date format, this sometimes causes Excel to save the date to the default Windows system format. This format can be changed in Configuration Panel | Regional Settings
    2. Make sure the .CSV file is formatted in UTF-8 code.
    3. Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad++ after it was saved to ensure the above two points.
- Logging can be configured in the Nlog.config file. Further information can be found here: https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file.



# Limitation
- CSV files need to be prepared with the correct format and required parameters, check [User Guide](BIM360-ProjectSetupTool-UsageGuide.pdf) for details.
- From the services listed in  [service_type parameters documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview/parameters/) only the following can be activated by this tool: **doc_manager**, **field**, **glue**. The parameter values field and glue are used for the **'classic'** products, not for the next gen products
- Copy folder can't copy permissions with this tool.
- **Copy Folder** only support **Plan** and **Project File** folder and their subfolders.
